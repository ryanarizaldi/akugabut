/*
 Write a recursive function that will return the longest word in a sentence. 
 In cases where more than one word is found, return the first one.

 Note: 
  - Special characters and symbols don't count as part of the word.
  - Return the longest word found in lowercase letters.
  - You are expected to solve this challenge via a recursive approach. If you not using recursive will deduct 75% of score
